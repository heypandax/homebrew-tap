# Homebrew CASK for the cc-pocket daemon (a prebuilt, notarized binary — NOT a buildable formula,
# so it needs no Command Line Tools). The cask file lives in the tap repo
# (heypandax/homebrew-tap → Casks/cc-pocket.rb); the artifact (.tar.gz) is hosted on the MAIN repo's
# Releases (heypandax/cc-pocket) — the url below points there. The tap holds only this description.
# Users: brew install --cask heypandax/tap/cc-pocket
cask "cc-pocket" do
  # Apple Silicon and Intel each get their own notarized build (jpackage bundles an arch-specific
  # JRE — see .github/workflows/release.yml). `arch` maps the running CPU to the asset suffix; the
  # sha256 differs per arch. Refresh BOTH after each release run (notarized tarballs aren't
  # bit-reproducible, so even the arm64 sha changes on a rebuild).

  caveats <<~EOS
    cc-pocket drives Claude Code, so install + sign in to it first:
      https://claude.com/claude-code   (run `claude` once to authenticate)

    The daemon was installed as a login service — it auto-starts on boot and reconnects.
    Just pair your phone:
      cc-pocket-daemon pair                        # shows a QR + 6-digit code

    Logs:  ~/Library/Logs/cc-pocket/daemon.err.log

    Optional — voice input from Android/desktop clients transcribes on this Mac:
      brew install whisper-cpp
  EOS
